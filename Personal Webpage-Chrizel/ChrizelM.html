        Two old friends meet again<br>
Wearin' older faces<br>
And talk about the places they've been<br>
Two old sweethearts who fell apart<br>
Somewhere a long ago<br>
How are they to know<br>
Someday they'd meet again<br>
And have a need for more than reminiscin'<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(165, 231, 231); border-radius: 50%;">
 Maybe this time <br>
It'll be lovin' they'll find<br>
Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br>
She's back in his life<br>
And if feels so right<br>
Maybe this time, love won't end<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;background-color: rgb(132, 230, 184); border-radius: 30%;">It's the same old feeling back again<br>
It's the one that they had back when<br>
They were tooyoung to know when love is real<br>
But somehow, some things never change<br>
And even time hasn't cooled the flame<br>
It's burnin' even brighter than it did before<br>
It got another chance, and if they take it<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(164, 186, 235); border-radius: 30%;">Maybe this time<br>
It'll be lovin' they'll find<br>
Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br>
She's back in his life<br>
And if feels so right<br>
Maybe this time, love won't end<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(235, 216, 164); border-radius: 50%;">She's smilin' like she used to smile way back then<br>
She's feelin' like she used to feel way back when<br>
They tried, but somethin' kept them<br>
Waiting for this magic moment<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(235, 164, 217); border-radius: 50%;">Maybe this time<br>
It'll be lovin' they'll find<br>
Maybe now they can be more than just friends<br>
She's back in his life<br>
And if feels so right<br>
Maybe this time<br>
Maybe this time<br>
Maybe this time, love won't end<br>
